    /**
     The possible values for `fast_diffusion` are:
     - 0: disabled.
     Every Single is explicitly represented by a diffusing point. The
     unattached Single move randomly, with the specified diffusion constant,
     and they may accumulate at certain regions of the simulation. That
     happens in particular with asters when the motors move inward. In fact,
     the aster can really act like black hole for the motors, as seen in
     experiments!
     
     - 1: attach Single along the length of fibers
     It is assumed that free Singles are uniformly distributed, and they are
     thus not explicitly represented. In this mode, Cytosim will only keep a
     count of the number of free motors, and directly attach these Singles by
     one of their Hand, at random positions of the fibers, irrespective of the
     manner in which the filaments are distributed in the simulation.
     The diffusion constant is not relevant.
     
     - 2: attach Single only near growing PLUS_ENDS
     Similar to mode 1, but Hand1 of Single is directly attached
     at random positions on the growing ends of the fibers.
