     The bending elasticity modulus `rigidity` has units of pN * um^2,

     absolute temperature (kT = k_B * T):

         abs_real( L / N - segmentation )

     (i.e. if the angle between consecutive segments is greater then 45 degrees).
     In that case, the simulation should be redone with a segmentation divided by 2,
     and the segmentation should be reduced until kinks do not appear.
