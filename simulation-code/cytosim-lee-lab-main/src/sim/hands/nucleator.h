/// A Hand that can nucleate a Fiber
/**
 The Nucleator is a Hand, and thus can bind and unbind from fibers,
 but in most cases, however you would want `binding_rate=0`.
 
 A free Nucleator can create new fibers with a prescibed rate.
 The rate, the type of fiber and the characteristics of the fiber are set
 as three values in property @ref NucleatorPar "nucleate".
 
 If the nucleator is part of a Couple, the parameter "nucleation_angle"
 can be set to define the direction of the new fiber with respect to the
 preexisting fiber (the one that is bound by the other Hand of the Couple).
 
 By default the nucleator stays attached at the end of the fiber that it has created.
 This can be changed by setting: @ref NucleatorPar "hold_end"

 See Examples and the @ref NucleatorPar.
