     This option controls if the nucleator will be attached (or not) to a fiber that it created.
     Possible values for `hold_end`:
     - off

     - minus_end
     .
     Note that a nucleator remains inactive as long as it is bound to a fiber.
     Thus, setting `hold_end = minus_end` in combination with a detachment rate of zero
     will limit nucleation to one fiber at a time, because in that case the nucleator
     can only be released when the fiber is deleted, for example after a catastrophe.
