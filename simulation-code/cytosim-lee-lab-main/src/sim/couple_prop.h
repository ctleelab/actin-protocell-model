     The criteria is based on the angle defined by the two fibers.
     Since fibers are oriented, the angle in Radian is well defined between -PI and +PI:
     - 0 corresponds to parallel fibers having the same orientation,
     - PI/2 correspond to orthogonal fibers,
     - -PI corresponds to parallel fibers having opposite orientation (antiparallel)

     The allowed angle correspond to +/- 60 degree, which is rather arbitrary.

     The possible values for `fast_diffusion` are:
     
     - 0: disabled.
       Every Couple is explicitly represented by a diffusing point. The
       unattached Couple move randomly, with the specified diffusion constant,
       and they may accumulate at certain regions of the simulation space. That
       happens in particular with asters when the motors move inward. In fact,
       the aster can act like a black hole for the motors, in certain conditions.

     - 1: attach Couple along the length of filaments
       It is assumed that free Couples are uniformly distributed, and they are 
       thus not explicitly represented. In this mode, Cytosim will only keep a 
       count of the number of free Couples, and directly attach these Couples by
       one of their Hand, at positions of the fibers selected randomly, irrespective
       of the manner in which the filaments are distributed spatially.
       In this mode, the Couple diffusion constant is not relevant.

     - 2: attach Couple only at growing PLUS_ENDS
       Similar to mode 1, but Hand1 of Couple is directly attached to the plus tips
       of growing fibers. The number of attachments is proportional to the new
       polymer mass, which is `time_step * growing_speed`, but occurs otherwise
       equally to every filaments.
     .
     
     Enabling `fast_diffusion` can make the simulation a bit faster when there
     are a lot of Couples, but another reason to use this mode is that it makes
     the model simpler, since the fraction of bound/free Couples can then be calculated
     analytically. This also avoid the accumulation of motors in aster and other
     organized structures, which are stronger in a 2D geometry, compared to 3D. 
     Thus one may wish to enable `fast_diffusion` in a 2D simulation to better
     represent a 3D system.
     
     `fast_diffusion` does not affect Couples in the attached state.

     the same Fiber. Such a degenerate binding may be impossible due to the molecular 
     configuration of the complex. Note that no restriction apply if the Hands

     The same rule apply when hand1 attempts to bind if hand2 is attached.
     
     Setting `min_loop=0` allows the two hands from the Couple to bind without
     restriction on the same fiber. In such a degenerate configuration, the link
     is unproductive as it cannot produce force, but the feature may be useful
     to combine activities such as cutting and motors.
