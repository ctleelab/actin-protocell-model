/// Divide-and-Conquer method to find all FiberSegment located near a given point in space
/**
A divide-and-conquer algorithm is used to find all segments of fibers close to a given point:
 
 -# It uses a grid 'fGrid' covering the space, initialized by setGrid().
    After initialization, each cell of the grid has an empty SegmentList (a list of FiberSegment*).
 -# clear() resets all lists on the grid
 -# paintGrid() distributes the segments specified in the arguments to the cell-associated SegmentList.
    One of the argument specifies a maximum distance to be queried (`max_range`).
    After the distribution, tryToAttach() is able to find any segment
    located at a distance `max_range` or less from any given point, in linear time.
 -# The function tryToAttach(X, ...) finds the cell on fGrid that contain `X`. 
    The associated SegmentList will then contains all the segments located at distance `max_range` or less from `X`. 
    tryToAttach() calls a function distanceSqr() sequentially for all the segments in this list,
    to calculate the exact Euclidian distance. 
    Finally, using a random number it tests the probability of attachment for the Hand given as argument.
 .
 
 @todo we could call paintGrid() only if the objects have moved by a certain threshold.
 This would work if we also extend the painted area around the rod, by the same threshold.
 we must also redo the paintGrid() when MT points are added or removed.
 
 Such algortihm should lead to large CPU gain, if calling clear() or paintGrid() is limiting,
 which is the case in particular in 3D, because the number of grid-cells is large.
