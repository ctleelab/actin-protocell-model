/// A class to calculate the motion of objects in Cytosim
/**
Meca solves the motion of objects defined by points (i.e. Mecable),
using an equation that includes terms for each interaction between Objects,
and also forces that are internal to an object, for instance bending elasticity
for Fibers, and external forces such as confinements.
The equation is formulated using linear-algebra:
 
    d vPTS/dt = mobility * mP * ( Force + mDiffP * vPTS )
 
 with
 
    Force = vBAS + ( mISO + mFUL + mR ) * vPTS
 
 The equation is solved for a small increment of time `time_step`, in the presence
 of Brownian motion, and at low Reynolds number, ie. a regime in which inertial
 forces that are proportional to mass are negligible.
 
 The equation contains `DIM * nbPoints()` degrees of freedom, where `nbPoints()`
 is the total number of points in the system. It contains vectors and matrices.
 The different  terms of the equation are:
 
 - Vector vPTS containing all the Mecable coordinates (x, y, z):
   Fiber, Sphere, Solid and other Mecable. 
 
 - Vector vBAS is of same size as vPTS, and includes the constant part obtained by
   linearization of the forces. It includes for instance the positions of Single,
   calibrated random forces simulating Brownian motion, and also offsets for periodic
   boundary conditions.
 
 - Matrix mISO is the isotropic part obtained after linearization of the forces.
   It operates similarly and independently on the different dimension X, Y and Z.
   mISO is square of size nbPoints(), symmetric and sparse.
 
 - Matrix mFUL is the non-isotropic part obtained after linearization of the forces.
   mFUL is square of size DIM*nbPoints(), symmetric and sparse.
 .
 
 Typically, mISO and mFUL will inherit the stiffness coefficients of the interactions, 
 while vBAS will get forces (stiffness * position). They are set by the member functions
 addLink(), addLongLink(), addSideLink(), addSlidingLink(), etc.

 - mR add the bending elasticity for Mecafil, or other internal forces.
   mR is symmetric of size DIM*nbPoints(), diagonal by blocks, each block corresponding to a Fiber.
 
 - mP applies the projection due to constrained dynamics.
   For Mecafil, this maintains the distance between neighboring points (longitudinal incompressibility). 
   mP is symmetric of size DIM*nbPoints(), diagonal by blocks, each block corresponding to a Fiber.
   mP is not actually calculated as a matrix:
   its application on each block is done by Mecable::projectForces()
 
 - mDiffP is a term coming from the derivative of the projection P.
   It can provide better numerical stability in some situations where the filament are stretched.
   You can however define ADD_PROJECTION_DIFF=0 to remove mDiffP.
 .
 
 
 Note: addLinks() calls have no effect if the given Mecapoint or Interpolation have a
 point in common, because the matrix elements would not be calcuated correctly 
 in that case. Generally, such interactions are anyway not desirable. It would 
 correspond for example to a link between two point of the same segment, without 
 effect since the segment is straight, or between two successive segments on the
 same Fiber, which at best would fold it in a non-physical way.
