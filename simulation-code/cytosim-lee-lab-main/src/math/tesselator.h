/// Provides a triangulation of a surface made by refining a Platonic solid
/**
 Platonic solids made of triangles are refined by subdividing the faces
 into smaller triangles. The faces are re-assembled to cover the surface
 without duplicating vertices.
 
 The level of refinement is set by an integer N > 0, corresponding to the
 number of section in which each edge of the original Platonic solid is divided.
