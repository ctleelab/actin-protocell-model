///\todo we could replace here the Coulomb repulsive interaction by a linear force
/* 
 Idea: A linear forces would allow us to solve an associated linear system on the
 coordinates of the points, using an iterative solver, that might be quite fast.
 The repulsive interaction only needs to take the first neighbours into account,
 so we could have local forces only, which would scale better than having all points
 interact, as is the case with the Coulomb energy.

/// Distribute points on the unit sphere, minimizing the 'electrostatic' energy
/**  The number of points is arbitrary, see
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalCode.html

Algorithm:
 -# The points are distributed randomly on the sphere
 -# A 1/r^3 repulsive force is assumed for all points, 
 to which corresponds a certain potential energy in 1/r^2
 -# New positions are calculated form the current one, the forces
 and an adjustable scaling factor:  dx = scale * ( force at x )
 -# The potential energy of the new configuration is calculated, and:
     - If the total energy is lower, the move is accepted and the scaling factor is increased,
     - If the energy is higher, the move is rejected and the scaling factor is reduced.
     .
 .
 
The procedure (steps 2-4) is continues until convergence.\n

The main method is the class constructor, or equivalently distributePoints(),
which take the number of points as argument and performs the calculation.
The coordinates of points can then be retrieved using either:

    - copyPositionsForAllPoints()
    - copyCoordinatesOfPoint()
